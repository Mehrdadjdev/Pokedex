# Pokedex

Building a Pokodex mini app using swift.

This simple 3-screen iOS app is a Swift code in MVC (UIKit version) and MVVM (SwiftUI version) that fetches data from an API, parses the response, sort them, and displays some of the data. The networking module has implementations for Async/Await.
